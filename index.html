<p>I have drawn since my childhood. My parents decided that I had to go to Art School. I was drawing at Art school for 11 years.</p>
<p> It was like a normal school with maths, french, english, literature and others lessons. 
But every week we had to draw for 18 hours at school and several hours at home to do a homework. 
It was not only draw lessons - we painted, drawed, did sculptures, ceramic objects. 
Our homework we had to do was not only at home: we were go to Zoo, to Museums, to a nature.</p>
 
<p>We were painting everywhere. It was very funny. I decided to left it like a hobby. </p>
<p>I wanted decide difficult tasks. </p>
<p>I went to University to learn maths, engineering and economic siences.</p>
