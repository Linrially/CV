<p>I have always been attracted to drawing since my childhood. 
My parents decided that the best option for me was to go to Art School. I was drawing at Art school for 11 years.</p>

<p> It was like a normal school with lessons in math, french, english, literature and others. 
However every week we had to draw for 18 hours at school and several hours at home. 
It was not only drawing lessons - we painted, did sculptures, ceramic objects. 
The homework we were assigned was not only for home, we drew at the zoo, at museums and in nature.</p>
 
<p>We were painting everywhere. It was very funny. I decided that drawing was a more of a hobby for me. </p>

<p>I was looking for something more challenging.</p>

<p>I went to University to learn math, engineering and economic sciences.</p>
